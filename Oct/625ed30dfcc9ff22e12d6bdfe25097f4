The Makhado Police have embarked on a massive hunt for a group of armed robbers after they attempted to rob a cash-in-transit vehicle at gunpoint. According to local police spokesperson Const Irene Radzilane, a Fidelity vehicle was driving to deliver cash to clients in Thohoyandou early Saturday morning. The driver of the truck remembers being followed by three vehicles, namely a black Toyota double-cab bakkie, a white Alpine Mercedes Benz and a black BMW. Shortly after passing the Piesanghoek turn-off, the bakkie overtook the Fidelity truck, flinging a device on the road that caused an explosion when the truck drove over it. “We are not yet sure what exactly it was that the suspects used that caused the explosion, but fortunately the truck driver was not injured,” said Radzilane on Tuesday. After the explosion, the suspects in the three vehicles opened fire on the driver of the truck. Afterwards, the police recovered spent ammunition cartridges from an R1 rifle, an AK47 assault rifle and a 9mm firearm. The truck driver was able to reach for his service pistol and return fire on the suspects. This scared off the suspects, who decided to rather make a run for it. He was, unfortunately, unable to take down the registration numbers of the vehicles. The police were quick to arrive on the scene and have opened a case of attempted robbery for further investigation. On Tuesday, the suspects were still at large and no arrests had been made.
