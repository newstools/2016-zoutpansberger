At least a 100 students received the paper beforehand via the social media app, WhatsApp.Tinyiko Khosa (52), the owner of the New Era and Mudzahisi private colleges in Malamulele, handed himself over to the Hawks&rsquo; investigation team. He allegedly distributed the paper among his pupils over WhatsApp.He briefly appeared in the Giyani Magistrate&rsquo;s Court last week, where he was denied bail, and willould remain in custody until his next court appearance on 19 December.The last matric exams were&nbsp;written on Tuesday, while the marking of about 11 million scripts would begin at 140 centres around the country on Thursday.The students from Giyani&rsquo;s papers will, however, be investigated further. According to Mhlanga, a statistical comparative analysis will be applied to the affected students and schools to establish if there are any peculiarities that need&nbsp;further investigation.He also said that the department would conduct a review of the colleges, while the Hawks hoped to make more arrests in the matter.Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
