In addition to the overall winner, two winners of each country are selected. Last year, hairstylist Taki Mabobo was the South African winner. This year Taki got good news again.&ldquo;After winning last year, you can&rsquo;t think of being in the top again! God is so great!&rdquo; said Taki Mabobo. She had just heard that she was selected as the second winner in South Africa. The&nbsp;phone call from Jas Jhally, Australian fashion director of Intercoiffure Mondial&rsquo;s Oceania Region, on 16 November came as a pleasant surprise.&ldquo;This year there was no prescribed theme for the hairstyle,&rdquo; said Connie. Taki chose to do an up-style with Eloise Spies as her model. &ldquo;I did the BIG bun, using a fake frizzy hairpiece inside the bun and covering it with my model&rsquo;s own smooth hair. Then I added shongololos on the side,&rdquo; said Taki with a twinkle in her eye. Her innovative style definitely made an impression on the judges. Her model&rsquo;s make-up was done by Danielle Rathbone and the photographer was Madeleen van den Berg.The photographer is a crucial part of the team&nbsp;since the judging for this competition is done exclusively on the photos. Madeleen did the photoshoots for Connie&rsquo;s overall win with model Lize Simon, as well as when Taki was the&nbsp;South African winner with Melissa Leeb as her&nbsp;model.&ldquo;The Oceania Region Award brings together professionals with a passion for hair fashion and photography, and will ultimately foster a signi cant national community of hair fashion pros,&rdquo; writes Jas Jhally. Intercoiffure Mondial is one of the most prominent leaders in the hairdressing world and operates in 55 countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;How do&nbsp;Connie and her team manage to keep up their achievements? &ldquo;Maybe it is because we keep our heart in it. Even when we watch television or look in magazines, our eyes always catch the hair, because that is what we love. We always ask what is next,&rdquo; said Connie and added that Taki had donevery well. &ldquo;Taki is definitely dedicated,&rdquo; said Connie.Taki says that in a competition like this where you don&rsquo;t win prize money or a trip, they do it for the fun of it. She says that Connie inspires them by telling them great fun stories about entering competitions. &nbsp;There is still a trophy awaiting Taki. &ldquo;The trophy is in London and Connie said we are going to find someone who will personally pick it up and bring it to us,&rdquo; Taki said.&nbsp; Linda van der Westhuizen has been with Zoutnet since 2001.
