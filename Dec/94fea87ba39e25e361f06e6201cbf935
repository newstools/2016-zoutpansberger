Date: 09 December 2016 By: News CorrespondentViewed: 510Residents of Louis Trichardt were treated to a colourful display of Christmas cheers when a large number of local cyclists took to the street as part of the Soutpansberg Cycling Club&rsquo;s annual Jingle Bell Toy Ride.To take part in the ride, cyclists had to decorate their bikes with Christmas lights or any other joyful decoration, as well as &ldquo;pay&rdquo; an entrance fee consisting of a soft toy or present. Toys could also be dropped off beforehand by residents at several drop-off points in town, with the cyclists then cycling to each of these drop-off points to collect the toys.The toys will be distributed to less fortunate children this Christmas with the help of pre-selected local charities. &nbsp;&ldquo;We want to thank each and every one who supported the initiative.Thank you also to Thompson&rsquo;s Motors for supplying support vehicles on the evening, as well as residents who waited along the route to support us and hand over gifts. You all helped to put a smile on many children&rsquo;s faces this festive season,&rdquo; said the club.&nbsp;Correspondent journalists&nbsp;from all over the region supply us with news and sport articles.&nbsp;Email: news@zoutnet.co.zaMore photos...
