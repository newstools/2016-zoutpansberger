Suspended Municipal Manger of the Makhado Municipality, Mr Isaac (Sakkie) Mutshinyali.Date: 07 November 2016 By: Kaizer NengovhelaViewed: 3310The Makhado municipal manager, Mr Isaac Mutshinayli, has been suspended, following serious allegations of misconduct, fraud and nepotism.Mutshinyali, also known as Sakkie, was suspended during a closed special council meeting last Thursday, that was described at the best of times as a stormy meeting.Municipal spokesperson Mr Louis Bobodi confirmed on Tuesday that the council&rsquo;s executive committee (Exco) carried out a mandate from the Council to place Mutshinyali under precautionary suspension for a term of 30 days. This time has been allocated in order to appoint an independent investigator who will have to present a report to the municipal&nbsp;council.Although Bobodi and the council have&nbsp;remained tight-lipped&nbsp;ever since the meeting&nbsp;about the reasons for the suspension, the Limpopo Mirror/Zoutpansberger was able to get hold of confidential documents stipulating the allegations.According to these documents, Mutshinayli&rsquo;s suspension was suggested by the mayor, Cllr Shonisani Sinyosi.&nbsp;&ldquo;It has to be mentioned that some of the accusations have tarnished the image of the municipality as an institution. The image of the municipal manager, both as an accounting officer and an individual, was tarnished as well,&rdquo; said Sinyosi.The mayor further said that she had received allegations from various whistleblowers about Mutshinyali&rsquo;s alleged misconduct, that he had awarded contracts without following the proper supply chain management regulations, had lied about his annual leave and was suspected of&nbsp;financial misconduct.A contractor, Spectrum Utility Management (Pty) Ltd (SUM), was allegedly appointed and paid in advance during the 2015/6 financial year to fulfil their contract in the 2016/7 year. Another service provider allegedly received an authorised payment of R400&nbsp;000 by Mutshinyali without ever finishing the electrification of Makushu Village.This week the Democratic Alliance (DA) said that they welcome the decision of the council.&nbsp;They said, however, that the matter should be thoroughly investigated to also verify the involvement of other senior financial management officials.&ldquo;Due to the nature of the allegations levelled against him, it is clear that Mutshinyali did not act alone in the irregular appointments of service providers and illegal payments,&rdquo; said the DA in a press release. &ldquo;The municipality has an outstanding debt of more than R170 million as a result of poor revenue-collection practices, and under his [Mutshinayli&#39;s] helm still fails to initiate plans to improve on the collection of revenue,&rdquo; they added.In the meantime, the Director of Development and Planning, Cllr Dakalo Sinthumule, will take up the job as acting municipal manager.Kaizer Nengovhela started writing stories for Limpopo Mirror more than a decade ago, in 2 000.
